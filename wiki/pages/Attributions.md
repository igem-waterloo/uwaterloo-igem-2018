# Attributions 

Our project would not have been possible without the help of several people. Here, we would like to take the time to recognise and thank everyone who helped us on our journey this year! 

### Interlab 
We would like to extend our most sincere gratitude to Prof. Raymond Legge (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo) and Andrew Assatory, a graduate student working under Prof. Legge. These results would not have been possible without their assistance. Prof. Legge kindly allowed us to use his BioTek Synergy 4 plate reader on very short notice, and Andrew accommodated our use of the plate reader into his busy schedule.
