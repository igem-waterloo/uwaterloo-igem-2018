#Interlab 

##Purpose 

We completed three calibrations, each of which measured standardised non-living samples provided by iGEM. These calibrations established absorbance and fluorescence baselines for further measurements, and gave a way to relate absorbance to number of E. coli-like particles. 

We then moved onto live E. coli, measuring the absorbance and fluorescence of populations carrying different GFP-encoding devices. It was possible to compute the fluorescence per cell for each device.

Lastly, we diluted E. coli cultures to a known absorbance, plated them on agar, and counted the resulting colonies. It was then possible to compare these results with the predictions made by our calibrations.

## Materials, Instrumentation, and Methods
E. coli strain K-12 DH5-alpha was the bacterial strain used.

The first calibration attempt used a Molecular Devices Model F5 reader and black 96-well plates with clear, flat bottoms. 

All subsequent measurements were completed using a BioTek Synergy 4 plate reader. It was configured as follows:
-Top Optics
-Pathlength correction turned off
-Temperature control turned off (room temperature)
-Sensitivity: 66
-600 nm absorbance wavelength
-485 nm fluorescence excitation wavelength
-525 nm fluorescence emission wavelength

The methods in the iGEM 2018 Interlab Study Protocol were followed as closely as possible, with the exception of the following deviations:

-Calibration #2: Microsphere Protocol (Attempt #1)
 -1.5-mL microfuge tubes were substituted for 2.0-mL tubes. The contents added to the tubes were exactly the same as specified in the procedure. 

-Calibration #2: Microsphere Protocol (Attempt #3)
 -Between attempts, 96-well plates were covered and sealed with parafilm for up to two days. 
 -Immediately before reading, we pipetted up and down in each well, then inserted into the plate reader and shook on “high” for 3 minutes. 

-Cell Measurement Protocol
 -The plates were shaken on “high” for 3 minutes prior to reading.
 -After picking two colonies from each transformant plate, we prepared frozen stock from each colony, then used the frozen stock to inoculate the 5-10 mL cultures.

CFU protocol
The plates were shaken on “high” for 3 minutes prior to reading.
After picking two colonies from each transformant plate, we prepared frozen stock from each colony, then used the frozen stock to inoculate the 5-10 mL cultures.

##Results and Discussion
Up to three attempts were required for each calibration in order to produce good data. Fresh samples were prepared for each attempt. The first attempts at all calibrations were completed using the Molecular Devices Model F5 reader, but problems with the fluorescence readings on the Molecular Devices Model F5 reader meant that all subsequent attempts were completed using the BioTek Synnergy 4 plate reader. The cell measurement protocol and CFU protocol were completed exclusively using the BioTek Synnergy 4 plate reader.
