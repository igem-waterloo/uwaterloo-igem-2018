#Interlab 

##Purpose 
The fifth International Inter-Laboratory Measurement Study aims to collect many UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy measurements of provided standards and E. coli carrying certain devices. By relating these data to plate counts, the Interlab study will make it easier to compare fluorescence measurements taken on different instruments, a significant improvement to synthetic biology research. 

We completed three calibrations, each of which measured standardised non-living samples provided by iGEM. These calibrations established absorbance and fluorescence baselines for further measurements, and gave a way to relate absorbance to number of E. coli-like particles. 

We then moved onto live E. coli, measuring the absorbance and fluorescence of populations carrying different GFP-encoding devices. It was possible to compute the fluorescence per cell for each device.

Lastly, we diluted E. coli cultures to a known absorbance, plated them on agar, and counted the resulting colonies. It was then possible to compare these results with the predictions made by our calibrations.
