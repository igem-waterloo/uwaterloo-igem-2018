# Math and Modeling Team

## Overview

Mathematical biology is at the cutting edge of synthetic biology. In collaboration with our [lab team] we have developed
a set of equations for describing population growth under the influence of optogenetics, as well as some
mathematical software to implement these models in the real world!

The team is structured into three sub-teams:

### Biomodels - tasked with the development of the mathematics required for this project

### Signals - tasked with the real-world implementation of these models through the use of control theory and statistical methods

### Robots - tasked with the development of software and electronics in order to use our model in the lab
