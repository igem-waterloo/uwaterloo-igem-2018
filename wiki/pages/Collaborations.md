# Collaborations 

The philosophy behind our project is that we can do better things when we work together - whether that be microbes working together in a co-culture to make useful products, or iGEM teams collaborating! Here, we will outline the collaborations we've participated in this year. 

## Interlab 
We found the interlab particularly interesting this year because it also related to our project. In the interlab, teams aimed to reduce variations in GFP fluorescence/expression. We think this is an important goal because in our project, we are measuring one of the bacterial populations in our co-culture using GFP. Hence, we wanted to help as many teams as possible participate in the intarlab study this year!

**Guelph iGEM** 

We gifted the Guelph iGEM team with black, flat, clear-bottomed, 96 well plates. 

**McMaster iGEM**

We gave the McMaster iGEM team *E. coli* DH5-alpha cells so that they could meet [requirement #2 for successful completion of the interlab study](http://2018.igem.org/Measurement/InterLab). 

## Mentoring, Brainstorming, and Troubleshooting
**McMaster iGEM**

We met with the McMaster iGEM team several times early in the year to discuss different projects each of our teams were considering. We listened to each other's ideas, and provided each other with feedback. 

**Guelph iGEM** 

We first met the Guelph iGEM team last year at oGEM 2017 (an meet-up we hosted with Ontario iGEM teams). It was their first year as an iGEM team. They described the struggles and financial barriers they were facing as a new team. We've kept in touch since then. We mentored members on their team about finances this year. Jehoshua Sharma, the Guelph team's head of research, reached out to us this summer to discuss how to obtain funding for an iGEM team. We offered advice regarding: 
 - how to pitch iGEM to department heads (as an amazing opportunity, a way to showcase the university on an international scale, etc.) 
 - how to obtain funding by reaching our to various departments/student societies
 
Members from both our teams also attended [Western SynBio Symposium 3.0](https://www.synbiowestern.com/) on July 26th, 2018. After the conference, we met up and discussed ways to improve our teams:
